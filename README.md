# AutonomousDecisionEngine

This Decision Engine is based on the Trolley Dillema, where an autonomous vehicle will have to decide between saving the life of the car's passengers or the life of the pedestrians. This project supports auditing to allow human judges to compare against the algorithm to explore personal biases.
